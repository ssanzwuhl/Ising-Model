# Smaller-Projects

As the name implies, this is a collection of smaller projects I have done throughout my Bachelor's degree in Universidad de CÃ³rdoba. These projects have usually been done out of pure curiosity, or to improve my lab life quality.

These projects include 
1. LlabPartner: A snippet that works as a lab companion so that calculating Gaussian error propagation in bulk is not needed to be done by hand.
2. ProjectEuler: My solutions to many [projecteuler.net/archive](projecteuler.net/archive) problems.
3. Crystal: A small crystal simulation in which I wanted to study the propagation of acoustic waves through systems of interacting oscillators.
4. integration: My very first attempt at a real gas simulation.
5. Difraction: An analytical solution to the general slit problem, to visualize how diffraction affects light measured at a screen at any distance.
